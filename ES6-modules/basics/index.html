        <h1>ES6 Modules: Basics</h1>
        <p>
          In its early days, Javascript programs were pretty small. Over time,
          splitting code into separate files became a necessity. Since 2015, ES6
          has introduced modules natively to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <b>Your goal</b>: Split code into different files with modules.
      </div>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You will need 3 JS files for this exercise:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>index.js</b> is your main module. It should only log or call structures imported from other files. Create it, and add it to your HTML file as a module. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>myChoices.js</b> is where you'll store values about yourself. Create the file. It can stay blank for now.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>computerChoices.js</b> contains a helper function. It has already been provided to you.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In <b>myChoices.js</b>:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Create a variable containing your favorite quote as a string. Export it by
                <b>default</b>. In <b>index.js</b>, import it and log it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create an object to represent your favorite movie or book.
                Export it as a <b>named export</b>. In <b>index.js</b>, import
                it and log it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a function to play Odds and Evens. It should accept three arguments: two
                numbers and a string with your choice for <i>"odd"</i> or <i>"even"</i>, and return a message 
                declaring the result. Export it as a <b>named export</b>.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            In <b>computerChoices.js</b>:
            <ol>
              <li>
                You were given a function that generates a random number. As a <b>named export</b>, export it in a different way then what you used so far.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            In <b>index.js</b>:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Import the function from <b>computerChoices.js</b>. Try to use a different syntax for importing!
              </li>
              <li>
                Import your function from <b>myChoices.js</b>. Call it with a number generated from the function from 
                <b>computerChoices.js</b> for the first parameter, your choice between 0 and 5 as the second parameter,
                and your choice of <i>"odd"</i> or <i>"even"</i> as the third parameter.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
